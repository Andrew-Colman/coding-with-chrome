<h1>Drawing with Scalable Vector Graphics</h1>

<p>An equilateral triangle has three angles of equal size and three sides of equal length. Because the angles of a triangle always sum to 180&deg;, each angle of an equilateral triangle is 60&deg;. This code draws an equilateral triangle.
</p>
<span style='font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;'>Challenge:</span> A right triangle has one angle of 90&deg;. Modify the code to draw a right triangle instead.

<div id='status' style='margin: 1em 0;'></div>
