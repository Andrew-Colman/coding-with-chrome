Coding with Chrome - i18n translation
======================================

Adding additional language support
-----------------------------------

### Create language folder

If your language is currently not supported, create a new folder under
`locales/[language code]/translation.json`.

For the language code, please use the ISO 639-3 definitions.
Example: `locales/deu/`

### Add the language code to the supportedUserLanguage

Add the new language code to the supported user language in the file
`src/locales/supported.js` like:

```diff
Locales['supportedLanguages'] = [
  'deu',
  'eng',
  'jpn',
+ '[language code]',
];
```

### Add additional build rule

Create a new build rule in the file `build/cwc/locales.js`.

Example for the "deu" translation:

```javascript
/**
 * DEU Translation.
 */
closureBuilder.build({
  name: 'Locales.deu',
  srcs: glob([
    'locales/deu/**/*.js',
  ]),
  externs: [
    'build/externs/locales.js',
  ],
  compress: true,
  options: {
    closure: {
      rewrite_polyfills: false,
    },
  },
  out: 'genfiles/core/js/locales/deu.js',
});
```

Additional language support
----------------------------

Take a look into the `locales/eng/` folder and start translating
the different type of text.

Please make sure that you only add translated text into this new file.
It also fine to start with a few line and adding the rest later.

If the new file is ready, create an pull request under the following URL:
<https://github.com/google/coding-with-chrome/pulls>

Translation of untranslated text
---------------------------------

TBD

Missing translations
---------------------

If you miss the translation for certain UI parts, please submit pull request to
add them.
All translations are using an KEY for the translation and maybe separates files
like **locales/deu/welcome_screen.js**.

### In JavaScript files

Use the global "i18t" function to add the translation to any text.
Please keep in mind that it could be that some text is already translated by
general functions.

```js
  i18t('SOME_UNIQUE_TEXT_KEY')
```

### In soy files

For soy files, use the {msg desc=""} {/msg} tags to mark any text.
Please keep in mind that it could be that some text is translated by
general functions instead directly.

```js
  {msg desc=""}
    SOME_UNIQUE_TEXT_KEY
  {/msg}
```
